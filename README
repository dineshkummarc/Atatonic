# About
Atatonic has it's main focus on typography. Vertical rhythm is one of the most important things in design and it almost always gives me troubles.
Atatonic includes a reset CSS, Typography rules and some dandy modules for forms and a (responsive) grid.

# SASS
The CSS has been coded in SASS and it uses default variables that setup your type's line-heights and margins. 
Fill out what kind of vertical rhythm you want and SASS creates everything automagically. Obviously you can also choose to do this yourself.
We crated an "em()" function that allows you to use all your line-heights in pixels. The function will calculate the em value. 
This way all copy scales nicely but the math stays in the simple "px" format.
